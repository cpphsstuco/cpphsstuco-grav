Hi,

I'd like to welcome you to the 2017-2018 Student Council.

If I haven't introduced myself to you yet, I am Jake Johnson, your President of Student Council for this year. If I have, you've seen my name once more.

The way the Council is run this year may be different then other years, however I'm sure you will be happy with any changes. To begin, we are holding regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings on the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month. Our first regular meeting will be on September 27th in B215 after school. Please note that attendance to meetings is mandatory to be involved in our other activities, but we hope to avoid anything longer then 30-60 minutes. **If you have sports and are not able to attend, please reach out to me or one of your Vice-Presidents so we can arrange a time for you to be filled in.**

Our All Day Meeting is currently scheduled for September 21st, however YOU MUST REPLY TO THIS EMAIL by Monday the 11th at 12:00 to attend.
Again, you must email me (jake@jakejakejake.com) with your name so that you can attend our meeting. After 12:00 on Monday we are making a roster for the Attendance office so that you can get an EDU for your classes.

Next Friday, the 15th of September, is our activities fair. Be sure to alert any clubs that you are a part of to ensure you have a table at the activities fair.

Thank you,

Jake Johnson
